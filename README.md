BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PYTHON)

It is a console-based Bank Management System developed using Python.
The project focuses on implementing core banking functionalities using file handling, functions, and modular programming concepts.

OVERVIEW

The Bank Management System is a Python-based console application that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and account management.

The project is divided into multiple modules to maintain clean separation of logic, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend. Account data is stored persistently using file handling techniques.

This project is mainly intended for academic purposes, Python practice, and understanding real-world banking workflows.
